		<h1>NeighborBoost</h1>
		<h4 class="neighbor">The Challenge</h4>
		<h5 class="neighbor"> Design a third-party app for Android mobile devices that highlight peopleâ€™s favourite local and undiscovered small businesses. Created as an entry to the 2021 Adobe Jam design contest.</h5>
		<h4 class="neighbor">The Problem</h4>
		<h5 class="neighbor"> Many new small businesses are popping up across the city, but they do not yet have a strong customer base. Users want to try out new businesses but are not sure what to expect. The app must increase revenue for the businesses and simplify finding a new local favourite for users.</h5>
		<h4 class="neighbor">The Solution</h4>
		<h5 class="neighbor"> NeighborBoost allows individuals to discover new businesses based on type of business, location, and reviews from neighbors. Small businesses partner with the app to grant exclusive discounts to neighborboost users. Users are shown businesses based on how many boosts a business has, how close it is, and if any discounts are available. Users are able to use the app to find small businesses, read reviews, and get directions to the location. </h5>
